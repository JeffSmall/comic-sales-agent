# comic-sales-agent — Monorepo Root

> **Read `docs/CPCD.md` first.** It defines the Comic Point-of-Care Data (CPCD) domain model
> that both the agent and the app depend on. Every feature decision should trace back to it.

## Architectural overview

This monorepo implements a two-sided AI sales agent for comics:

1. **Agent** (`agent/`) — a Python [Google ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) agent that
   handles natural-language sales conversations, looks up inventory, and emits structured
   **A2UI catalog payloads** telling the app what to render.

2. **App** (`app/`) — a Flutter iOS app that receives A2UI payloads via the GenUI SDK and
   renders them as Material 3 components following the Tufte infographic doctrine.

3. **Shared catalog** (`shared/catalog/`) — the JSON/YAML schema that both sides agree on.
   The agent produces it; the app consumes it. Neither side may bypass this boundary.

## Key invariants

- The agent never sends raw HTML or styled text. It sends catalog payloads only.
- The app never calls LLM APIs directly. It renders what the agent prescribes.
- All cross-cutting data types live in `shared/catalog/` and are versioned.

## Compact Instructions (for context summarization)

When this file is read at the start of a new session, everything below fully describes
the current state of the project. No prior conversation history is needed.

---

### Phase 1 — What was built and how it works

#### Spike A — ADK agent emitting A2UI (COMPLETE)

The agent lives at `agent/comic_sales/agent.py`. It uses Google ADK to host a Gemini
conversation and emits A2UI JSON that the Flutter app renders as native widgets.

**Key decisions and gotchas discovered during implementation:**

- **Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash` — `gemini-2.0-flash` was deprecated mid-session and
  returns 404. Never use `gemini-2.0-flash`.

- **Server mode**: `adk api_server --a2a --port 8001 comic_sales` — NOT `adk web`.
  `adk web` only exposes a proprietary `/run_sse` endpoint; the Flutter GenUI SDK speaks
  A2A protocol, which requires `adk api_server --a2a`.

- **Agent module path**: The folder name `comic_sales/` becomes the A2A URL segment.
  The Flutter app connects to `http://127.0.0.1:8001/a2a/comic_sales`.

- **A2A agent card**: `agent/comic_sales/agent.json` is required by `adk api_server --a2a`
  to register the agent. Without it the server fails to set up the A2A agent.

- **Callable instruction** (CRITICAL): The `instruction` parameter of `Agent()` MUST be a
  callable, not a plain string:
  ```python
  def instruction(_context) -> str:
      return _INSTRUCTION
  root_agent = Agent(..., instruction=instruction)
  ```
  ADK template-substitutes `{…}` tokens in plain string instructions, which destroys the
  embedded A2UI JSON schema (raises `KeyError: Context variable not found: expression`).

- **createSurface before updateComponents** (CRITICAL): The system prompt must instruct
  the model to emit a `createSurface` block BEFORE any `updateComponents` block.
  `SurfaceController` buffers `updateComponents` messages until it has seen `createSurface`
  for that `surfaceId`. The exact `catalogId` must be:
  `https://a2ui.org/specification/v0_9/basic_catalog.json`
  (matches `BasicCatalogItems.asCatalog()` in Flutter — the Python `a2ui-agent-sdk` uses a
  different catalogId; do not use its default).

- **Billing**: The Google API key requires billing enabled on the Cloud project. The free
  tier quota is `limit: 0` for Gemini 2.5.

#### Spike B — Flutter app rendering A2UI (COMPLETE)

The app lives at `app/lib/main.dart`. It connects to the ADK agent via A2A, receives
A2UI JSON wrapped in `<a2ui-json>` tags, and renders it using the GenUI SDK.

**Wiring (in initState order):**
```
SurfaceController(catalogs: [BasicCatalogItems.asCatalog()])
  ↓
A2uiTransportAdapter(onSend: _sendToAgent)
  ↓
A2uiAgentConnector(url: Uri.parse('http://127.0.0.1:8001/a2a/comic_sales'))
  ↓
Conversation(controller: _surfaceController, transport: _transport)
```

**Key decisions and gotchas discovered during implementation:**

- **GenUI packages** (pinned):
  ```yaml
  genui: 0.9.2
  genui_a2a: 0.9.0
  a2a: 4.2.0
  logging: any
  ```

- **Rendering bug root cause** (CRITICAL — the hardest bug of Phase 1):
  `A2uiParserTransformer` calls `_emitMessage(decoded)` where `decoded` comes from
  `jsonDecode()`. Dart's `jsonDecode` returns `Map<String, dynamic>` at runtime. The check
  inside `_emitMessage` is `if (json is Map<String, Object?>)` — at runtime in Dart's sound
  null-safety mode, `Map<String, dynamic>` does NOT pass this check, so the parsed JSON is
  silently dropped and no `A2uiMessageEvent` is ever emitted. This is a bug in `genui 0.9.2`.

- **Rendering fix**: After `connectAndSend` completes and the full response is buffered,
  regex-extract every `<a2ui-json>…</a2ui-json>` block, decode with an explicit
  `Map<String, Object?>.from(decoded as Map)` cast, and call `_transport.addMessage()`
  directly. See `_injectA2uiFromBuffer()` and `_responseBuffer` in `main.dart`.
  **This fallback is the active rendering path.** `addChunk` is still called (for
  `ConversationContentReceived` / text streaming), but A2UI messages only flow via the
  fallback.

- **A2UI arrives as text, not data**: The agent wraps A2UI JSON in `<a2ui-json>` tags
  inside a `TextPart`. It does NOT arrive as a `DataPart`. Therefore `_connector.stream`
  (DataPart messages) never fires for A2UI; only `_connector.textStream` carries the payload.

- **GenUI verbose logging**: Set `Logger.root.level = Level.ALL` and listen on
  `Logger.root.onRecord` — the `genUiLogger` (named `'GenUI'`) propagates to root and
  produces detailed widget-build traces useful for debugging.

### Vendor patches — must re-apply after clean installs

These are patches to files outside the repo. They are fragile (lost on `flutter clean`,
new machines, CI). A future task is to fork these packages and add proper git dependencies.

**Patch 1 — ADK 2.2.0 json import shadowing**
File: `agent/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/google/adk/cli/fast_api.py` ~line 748

Inside the `if gemini_enterprise_app_name:` block, change:
```python
import json
```
to:
```python
import json as _json
```
Reason: The local `import json` inside that `if` block is hoisted to function scope by
Python, shadowing the module-level `json` import. Any code after that point that calls
`json.load()` fails with `cannot access local variable 'json' before assignment`.

**Patch 2 — genui_a2a 0.9.0 null safety crash**
File: `~/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/genui_a2a-0.9.0/lib/src/a2a/core/events.g.dart`

In `_$ArtifactUpdateFromJson`, change:
```dart
append: json['append'] as bool,
lastChunk: json['lastChunk'] as bool,
```
to:
```dart
append: json['append'] as bool? ?? false,
lastChunk: json['lastChunk'] as bool? ?? false,
```
Reason: ADK sends `artifact-update` SSE events without the `append` and `lastChunk` fields.
The generated code casts `null as bool`, which crashes with
`type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'bool' in type cast`.

---

### Phase 2 — What comes next

**Goal:** Replace the hardcoded watchlist in `agent/comic_sales/agent.py` with real data
from Firestore. The Flutter app and GenUI rendering pipeline do not need to change.

**Planned changes:**
1. Set up a Firestore collection (e.g. `watchlist/{userId}/comics/{comicId}`)
2. Add a Firestore read tool to the ADK agent (replaces the hardcoded `WATCHLIST` list)
3. The agent calls the tool at query time; the tool returns the user's real comics
4. The system prompt stays the same; only the data source changes

**Scope boundary:**
- v1 (current): local agent, hardcoded data, BasicCatalog, no auth
- v2 (Phase 2): local agent, Firestore data, BasicCatalog, no auth
- v3 (deferred): Cloud Run deploy, auth, push notifications, custom catalog
